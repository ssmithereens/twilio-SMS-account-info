#### Optional parameters

##### Concurrency

The default concurrency is 25, but if you want to adjust this you can pass in an additional parameter:

```
node generateSummaryBillCsv.js [Account SID] [Account Auth Token] [Start Date (YYYY-MM-DD)] [End Date (YYYY-MM-DD)] [Concurrency]
```

```
node generatePhoneNumberCsv.js [Account SID] [Account Auth Token] [Concurrency]

```

Please note that Twilio accounts have a default GET concurrency of 100.

##### Time interval

By default pullCallLogs pulls logs in 2 hour chunks. If you want to pull larger time slots you can adjust this by passing in an additional parameter with the number of minutes like so: 
```
node pullCallLogs.js [Account SID] [Account Auth Token] [Start Date YYYY-MM-DD] [End Date YYYY-MM-DD] [Concurrency] [Time Interval to pull in]
```

##### UTC

By default pullCallLogs pulls logs by interpretting the date as Pacific Time. If you want to pull logs in as a UTC timestamp, you can do the following:

```
node pullCallLogs.js [Account SID] [Account Auth Token] [Start Date YYYY-MM-DD] [End Date YYYY-MM-DD] [Concurrency] [Time Interval to pull in] utc
